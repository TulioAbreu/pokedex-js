# Pokédex-JS

This is a project made for "Web Data Management" course on my university, where I had to use web pages as a database for any application. This is not a commercial project, all data scrapped from websites are not mine!

# Quick start

## Starting back-end

```shell
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## Starting front-end
```shell
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```


# Used websites

- [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page)

- [PokémonDB](https://pokemondb.net)

# I DON'T recommend you to use this application. Besides Web Scraping being useful, content creators dont want you to scrape their content!
